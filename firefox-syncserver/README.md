# Firefox Sync Server

As the latest stable release of Firefox Sync Server is still based on Python2, it's recommended to run it in a docker container to avoid some conflicts. Refers to: [Dockerfile-CN](/firefox-syncserver/Dockerfile-CN).

If server locates in the mainland of China, you might modify `Dockerfile` in the repo, or there might be network error occurred.
